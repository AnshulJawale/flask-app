Release Date : 2004-10-05

Votes : 0
Overview : Since 1990 David Icke has been on an amazing journey of self and collective discovery to establish the real power behind apparently "random" world events like 9/11 and the "war on terrorism". Here he reveals that a network of interbreeding bloodlines manipulating through their web of interconnecting secret societies have been pursuing an agenda for thousands of years to impose a globally centralized fascist state with total control and surveillance of the population.  The attacks of September 11th - not the work of "bin Laden" - and the subsequent "war on terrorism" are a means through which this is designed to be achieved.  Over more than six hours and with hundreds of illustrations, David Icke also reveals the illusion that is life in this "physical" reality. How is the "world" a provable illusion - just a lucid dream? How do we create it and how can we change the dream to one that we would like to experience?
